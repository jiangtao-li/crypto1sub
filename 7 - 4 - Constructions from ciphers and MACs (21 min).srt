1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,837
本节中我们要构建认证加密系统
In this segment, we're gonna construct
authenticated encryption systems. Since we

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:08,250
由于我们已经有了CPA安全加密，我们有安全MAC
already have CPA secured encryption, and
we have secure MACs, the natural question

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,824
自然就有问题，我们能否把两者相结合，来获得认证加密？
is whether we can combine the two somehow,
in order to get authenticated encryption.

4
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:15,721
那正是我们本节要做的。认证加密
And if, that's exactly what we're gonna do
in this segment. Authenticated encryption

5
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,447
于2000年被提出，在两篇独立的论文里
was introduced in the year 2000, in two
independent papers that I point to at the

6
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:25,915
本章最后我会讲到。但在这之前，许多密码学库
end of this module. But before then, many
crytpolibraries provided an API that

7
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:31,215
提供了支持CPA安全加密的API，以及MAC
separately supported CPA secure
encryption, and MAC-ing. So there was one

8
00:00:31,215 --> 00:00:36,175
有个函数用来实现CPA安全加密。例如，带随机IV的CBC
function for implementing CPA secure
encryption. For example, CBC with a random

9
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:41,136
另一个函数用来实现MAC。然后每个开发者
IV. And another function for implementing
a MAC. And then every developer that

10
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:45,646
都想分别实现CPA安全的加密机制
wanted to implement encryption, had to,
himself, call separately the CPA secure

11
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:50,552
和MAC机制。特别是，每个开发者
encryption scheme and the MAC scheme. In
particular, every developer had to invent

12
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:55,697
必须自己发明组合加密和MAC的方法
his own way of combining encryption and
MAC-ing to provide some sort of

13
00:00:55,697 --> 00:00:59,376
来提供某种认证加密。但由于组合加密和MAC的目的
authenticated encryption. But since the
goals of combining encryption and MAC-ing

14
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:03,690
当时理解得不好，因为认证加密还没被定义
wasn't well understood since authenticated
encryption hasn't yet been defined, it

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,497
还不清楚哪种加密与MAC的组合是正确的
wasn't really clear which combinations of
encryption and MAC-ing are correct and

16
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:13,243
哪些又不是。所以，我们刚才说的每个项目都必须
以它们自己的方式实现这个组合
which aren't. And so, every project as I
said had to invent its own combination.

17
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:17,202
事实上，没有一个组合是正确的。我可以告诉大家
And in fact, not all combinations were
correct. And I can tell you that the most

18
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:22,556
在软件项目中最常见的错误是不正确地
common mistake in software projects were
basically incorrectly combining the

19
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:27,025
组合加密和完整性机制。希望在本章结束后
encryption and integrity mechanisms. So
hopefully, by the end of this module, you

20
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:31,260
大家会知道如何正确组合它们，不会自己再犯错误
will know how to combine them correctly,
and you won't be making these mistakes

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,174
我们看一些CPA安全加密和MAC的组合
yourself. So let's look at some
combinations of CPA secure encryption and

22
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:39,303
由不同的项目提出的。这里有三个例子
MAC, that were introduced by different
projects. So here are three examples. So,

23
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:43,816
首先，在所有三个例子里，有一个单独的密钥用来加密
first of all, in all three examples,
there's a separate key for encryption, and

24
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:47,774
一个单独的密钥用来MAC。这两个密钥相互独立
a separate key for MACing. These two
keys are independent of one another, and

25
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,224
都是在会话建立阶段生成的。我们将在本课程稍后看到
both are generated at session setup time.
And we're gonna see how to generate these

26
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:57,071
如何生成这两个密钥。第一个例子在SSL协议里
two keys later on in the course. So the
first example is the SSL protocol. So the

27
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:02,681
SSL组合加密和MAC，希望能获得认证加密
way SSL combines encryption and MAC in the
hope of achieving authenticated encryption

28
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:07,656
组合方法如下：取明文m，然后计算明文m的MAC
is the following. Basically you take the
plain text, m, and then you compute a MAC

29
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:13,415
使用MAC密钥kI，计算明文m的标签
on the plain text, m. So you use your MAC
key, kI, to compute tag for this message

30
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:17,787
然后你可以把标签附在明文后面
m. And then you can concatenate the tag to
the message and then you encrypt the

31
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:22,580
然后加密这个明文和标签的联结，得到最终的密文
concatenation of the message and the tag
and what comes out is the actual final cipher text.

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,710
这是一号方案。第二个方案在IPsec中
So that's option number one. The
second option is what IPsec does. So

33
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,160
取明文，首先加密这个明文
here, you take the message. The first
thing you do is you encrypt the message.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,692
然后计算得到的密文的标签
And then, you compute a tag on the
resulting cipher text. So you notice the

35
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:40,238
大家注意到这个标签是基于得到的密文计算的
tag itself is computed on the resulting
cipher text. A third option is what the

36
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:45,429
第三个方案是来自SSH协议的。这里，SSH取明文
SSH protocol does. So here, the SSH takes
the message, and encrypts it using a CPA

37
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:50,944
使用CPA安全的加密机制加密明文。然后，
把明文标签附在后面
secure encryption scheme. And then, to it,
it concatenates a tag of the message. The

38
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:55,567
IPsec与SSH不同之处在于，IPsec中
difference between IPsec and SSH, is that
in IPsec, the tag is computed over the

39
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:59,988
标签是根据密文计算的，
在SSH中，标签是根据明文计算的
cipher text, whereas, in SSH, the tag is
computed over the message. And so these

40
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:04,536
这就是三个完全不同的组合加密和MAC的方法
are three completely different ways of
combining encryption and MAC. And the

41
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:09,090
问题是，哪个是安全的？大家想想
question is, which one of these is secure?
So, I will let you think about this for a

42
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,105
然后我们继续分析
second, and then when we continue we'll do
the analysis together.

43
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:17,164
我们从SSH的方法开始。在SSH的方法中，大家注意
Okay. So let's start with the SSH method. So 
in the SSH method you notice that the tag

44
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:21,629
标签是由明文计算的，然后把标签以明文的形式附在密文的后面
is computed on the message and then 
concatenated in the clear to the cipher text.

45
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:26,407
这就有很大的问题，因为MAC本身不是为私密性设计的
Now this is actually quite a problem 
because MACs themselves are not designed

46
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:30,784
MAC仅为完整性设计。事实上
to provide confidentiality. MACs are only 
designed for integrity. And in fact, there's

47
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:36,008
仅以输出明文中的几位作为MAC的话，也没有错
nothing wrong with a MAC that as part of
the tag outputs a few bits of the plain

48
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:41,458
输出明文M中的几位，也是很好的标签
text. Outputs a few bits of the message M.
That would be a perfectly fine tag. And yet if

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:46,667
如果我们这样做，会完全破坏CPA安全性
we did that, that would completely break
CPA security here, because some bits of

50
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:51,815
因为明文的若干位在密文里被泄漏了。
所以对于这个SSH的方法
the message are leaked in the cipher text.
And so the SSH approach, even though the

51
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:56,595
尽管对于SSH这个协议本身来说没有问题
specifics of SSH are fine and the
protocol itself is not compromised by

52
00:03:56,595 --> 00:04:00,818
也没有因为这个组合而被破解，一般来说
还是不建议使用这种方法
this specific combination, generally it's
advisable not to use this approach. Simply

53
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:05,928
因为MAC签名算法的输出会泄漏明文中的一些位
because the output of the MAC signing algorithm might leak bits of the message. So

54
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:11,481
现在我们看SSL和IPsec。事实上，IPsec的方法
now let's look at SSL and IPsec. As it
turns out, the recommended method actually

55
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:16,556
更为推荐。因为无论你使用什么CPA安全系统
is the IPsec method. Because it turns out
no matter what CPA secure system and MAC

56
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:21,134
和MAC密钥，组合总能提供认证加密
key you use the combination is always
gonna provide authenticated encryption.

57
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:26,070
让我非常简单地解释一下为什么
Now let me very, very briefly explain why.
Basically what happens is once we encrypt

58
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,005
一旦我们加密了明文，明文的内容就被隐藏在密文里了
the message well the message contents now
is hidden inside the cipher text and now

59
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:35,761
现在当我们计算密文的标签时，我们用这个标签
when we compute a tag of the cipher text
basically we're locking, this tag locks

60
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:40,815
给密文上了锁，确保没人可以产生一个不同的密文
the cipher text and makes sure no one can
produce a different cipher text that would

61
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:45,314
却能看起来是有效的。因此这个方法确保任何对密文的修改
look valid. And as a result this approach
ensures that any modifications to the

62
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:49,555
都会被解密者检测出来，因为MAC无法验证
cipher text will be detected by the
decrypter simply because the MAC isn't

63
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:54,026
实际上，SSL方法中，有一些病态的例子
gonna verify. As it turns out, for the SSL
approach, there actually are kind of

64
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:59,348
你把CPA安全的加密系统和一个安全的MAC组合起来
pathological examples, where you combine
CPA secure encryption system with a secure

65
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:03,542
结果却对一个选择密文攻击是脆弱的
MAC. And the result is vulnerable to a
chosen cipher text attack, so that it does

66
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:07,978
所以SSL的方法实际上不提供认证加密
not actually provide authenticated
encryption. And basically, the reason that

67
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,824
这个会发生的原因是，加密机制和MAC算法之间
could happen, is that there's some sort of
a bad interaction between the encryption

68
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:17,319
有一些不好的互动。事实上，会有一个选择密文攻击
scheme and the MAC algorithm. Such that,
in fact, there will be a chosen cipher

69
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,752
如果你设计了一个新的项目
text attack. So if you're designing a new
project the recommendation now is to

70
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:26,162
现在总是推荐先加密，然后计算MAC，因为
无论你组合了什么样的CPA安全加密和MAC算法
always use encrypt then MAC because that
is secure no matter which CPA secure

71
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:30,607
得到的组合总是安全的。现在看个术语
encryption and secure MAC algorithm you're
combining. Now, just to set the

72
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:37,995
这个SSL方法有时叫做"先MAC后加密"
terminology, the SSL method is sometimes
called MAC-then-encrypt. And the

73
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:45,039
IPsec的方法叫做"先加密后MAC"。
尽管我们不应使用SSH的方法
IPsec method is called encrypt-then-MAC.
The SSH method even though you're

74
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,898
但这种方法也有名字"加密且MAC"。好
我经常使用"先加密后MAC"
not supposed to use it, is called encrypt-and-MAC. Okay, so I'll often refer to

75
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:57,002
和"先MAC后加密"来区分SSL和IPsec
encrypt-then-MAC, and MAC-then-encrypt to
differentiate SSL and IPsec. Okay, so

76
00:05:57,002 --> 00:06:02,112
重复一下我刚才所讲的。IPsec方法"先加密后MAC"
just to repeat what I've just said. The IPsec
method encrypt-then-MAC always

77
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:07,160
总是提供认证加密。如果你从一个CPA安全的密码和一个安全MAC出发
provides authenticated encryption. If you start 
from a CPA secure cipher and a secure MAC

78
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,110
你总会获得认证加密的。如我所说，事实上
you will always get authenticated
encryption. As I said, MAC-then-encrypt in

79
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,737
"先MAC或加密"有一些病态的情况，结果对CCA攻击是脆弱的
fact, there are pathological cases where
the result is vulnerable to CCA attacks and

80
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:20,308
因此"先MAC或加密"不提供认证加密
therefore does not provide authenticated
encryption. However, the story's a little

81
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:24,653
但是，实际上比这要有趣
bit more interesting than that, in that,
it turns out, if you're actually using

82
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:29,224
如果你使用随机计数器模式或随机CBC
randomized counter mode or randomized CBC,
then it turns out, for those particular

83
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:33,625
那么对那些CPA安全的加密机制，"先MAC后加密"
CPA secure encryption schemes, MAC-then-encrypt
actually does provide authenticated

84
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:38,028
确实提供了认证加密，因此是安全的。事实上
encryption and therefore it is secure. In
fact, there's even a more interesting

85
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:42,334
更有趣的是如果你使用了随机计数器模式
twist here in that if you're using
randomized counter mode. Then, it's enough

86
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:46,804
那么你的MAC算法只要是一次性安全的就够了
that your MAC algorithm just be one time
secure. It doesn't have to be a fully

87
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:51,561
不需要是完全安全的MAC。只需要当密钥只用于
加密单个信息时是安全的即可
secure MAC. It just has to be secure when
a key is used to encrypt a single message,

88
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:56,088
我们讨论信息完整性时，看到过有一些快得多的MAC算法
okay? And when we talked about message
integrity, we saw that there are actually

89
00:06:56,088 --> 00:07:00,575
它们是一次性安全的，而非完全安全的MAC
much faster MACs that are one time secure
than MACs that are fully secure. As a

90
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:04,454
因此如果你使用随机计数器模式，"先MAC后加密"
result, if you're using randomized counter
mode MAC-then-encrypt could actually

91
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:08,187
实际上可以构造一个更为有效率的加密机制
result in a more efficient encryption
mechanism. However, I'm going to repeat

92
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:12,213
但我还要重复一遍。推荐使用"先加密后MAC"
this again. The recommendation is to use
encrypt-then-MAC and we're going to see a

93
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:16,093
我们将看到许多针对未使用"先加密后MAC"的系统的攻击
number of attacks on systems that didn't
use encrypt-then-MAC. And so just to make

94
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:20,120
为了确保安全，同时不必思考太多
sure things are secure without you having
to think too hard about this. Again, I am

95
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,118
我推荐大家始终使用"先加密后MAC"
going to recommend that you always use
encrypt-then-MAC. Now, once the concept of

96
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:27,759
现在，一旦认证加密的观念变得更为流行
authenticated encryption became more
popular, a number of standardized

97
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,609
很多组合加密和MAC的标准方法便涌现出来
approaches for combining encryption and
MAC turned up. And those were even

98
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:35,978
还有些是国家标准局(NIST)的标准方法。我将讨论其中三个标准
standardized by the National Institute of
Standards. So I'm just gonna mention three

99
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:41,031
其中两个是由NIST标准化的
of these standards. Two of these were
standardized by NIST. And these are

100
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:46,138
分别叫做Galois计数器模式(<b>GCM</b>)和CBC计数器模式(<b>CCM</b>)。
我来解释一下它们的工作过程
called Galois counter mode and CBC counter
mode. And so let me explain what they do.

101
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:51,245
Galois计数器模式使用了计数器模式加密
Galois counter mode basically uses counter
mode encryption, so a randomized counter

102
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:56,164
即使用Carter-Wegman MAC的随机计数器模式，
一个非常快速的Carter-Wegman MAC
mode with a Carter-Wegman MAC, so a very
fast Carter-Wegman MAC. And the way the

103
00:07:56,164 --> 00:08:01,146
GCM的Carter-Wegman MAC如下工作：
它是待求MAC的信息的一个哈希函数
Carter-Wegman MAC works in GCM is it's
basically a hash function of the message

104
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:06,311
然后用一个PRF加密哈希的结果
that's being MACed. And then the result is
encrypted using a PRF. Now this hash

105
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:11,562
现在GCM里的这个哈希函数已经很快了
function in GCM is already quite fast to
the point where the bulk of the running

106
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:15,845
GCM的运行时间受制于计数器模式
time of GCM is dominated by the counter
mode encryption and it's even made more so

107
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:22,371
为了更快，Intel引入了一个特殊指令PCLMULQDQ
in that Intel introduces a special
instruction PCLMULQDQ specifically

108
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:27,432
特别为此设计，目标是让GCM的这个哈希函数跑得尽可能的快
designed for the purpose of making the
hash function in GCM run as fast as possible.

109
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:32,950
现在CCM计数器模式是另一个NIST标准。它使用CBC MAC
Now CCM counter mode is another
NIST standard. It uses a CBC MAC and

110
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,276
然后用计数器模式加密。这个机制使用MAC
then counter mode encryption. So this
mechanism, you know, this uses MAC, then

111
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:40,906
然后加密，就像SSL那样。这并不是推荐的方法
encrypt, like SSL does. So this is
actually not the recommended way of doing

112
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:44,023
但因为使用的是计数器模式，这实际上
things, but because counter mode
encryption is used. This is actually a

113
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,945
是一个很好的加密机制。关于CCM我要指出一点
perfectly fine encryption mechanism. One
thing that I'd like to point out about

114
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:53,799
一切都是基于AES的。大家注意，它的CBC-MAC使用了AES
CCM, is that everything is based on AES.
You notice, it's using AES for the CBC

115
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,778
它的计数器模式也是使用的AES。因此
MAC, and it's using AES for the counter
mode encryption. And as a result, CCM can

116
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:03,084
CCM可以用相对少的代码实现，
因为需要的仅为AES引擎
be implemented with relatively little
code. Cause all you need is an AES engine

117
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:08,343
其他都不需要。因为这点，CCM被WiFi所采用
and nothing else. And because of this, CCM
actually was adopted by the Wi-Fi

118
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:13,963
事实上，你很有可能每天都在使用CCM
alliance, and in fact, you're probably
using CCM on a daily basis if you're using

119
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:19,093
如果你使用加密的WiFi 802.11i，那么
你就在使用CCM来加密
encrypted Wi-Fi 802.11i then you're
basically using CCM to encrypt traffic

120
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:23,450
你的笔记本和接入点之间的通信。
还有一个模式叫做EAX
between your laptop and the access point.
There's another mode called a EAX that

121
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,922
使用的计数器模式加密，然后是CMAC。
大家注意，这次是先加密后MAC
uses counter mode encryption, and then
CMAC. So, again you notice encrypt-then-MAC

122
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:31,906
这是另一个很好的模式。我们待会来对这些模式做个比较
and that's another fine mode to
use. We'll do a comparison of all these

123
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:36,806
现在我想提一下，首先
modes in just a minute. Now I wanted to
mention that first of all, all these modes are

124
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:41,190
所有的这些模式都是基于新鲜值的。换句话说
它们不使用任何随机性，但它们取新鲜值为输入
nonce-based. In other words, they don't
use any randomness but they do take as

125
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,360
而且每个密钥的新鲜值是唯一的，换句话说
input a nonce and the nonce has to be
unique per key. In other words, as you

126
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,600
大家记得，有序对(密钥，新鲜值)永远不应该重复使用
remember, the pair (key, nonce)
should never ever, ever repeat. But the

127
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,851
但新鲜值本身不一定是随机的，所以完全可以使用一个计数器
nonce itself need not be random, so
it's perfectly fine to use a counter, for

128
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:57,520
比如新鲜值。另一个重要的地方是
example, as a nonce. And the other
important point is that, in fact, all

129
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,384
事实上，所有的这些模式被称为
带相关数据的认证加密(<b>AEAD</b>)
these modes are what's called
authenticated encryption with associated

130
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:04,936
这是一个认证加密的扩展
data. This is an extension of
authenticated encryption, that comes

131
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:10,884
这在网络协议中经常出现。AEAD的想法是
up very often in networking protocols. So
the idea between AEAD is that, in fact,

132
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:15,223
提供给加密模式的信息不被完全加密
the message that's provided to the encryption
mode is not intended to be fully

133
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:19,924
只有部分信息是被加密的
encrypted. Only part of the message is
intended to be encrypted, but all of the

134
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:24,157
但所有信息是被认证的。这里一个好例子是网络数据包
message is intended to be authenticated. A
good example of this is a network packet.

135
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:29,408
考虑一个IP包，有报文头，然后是封装数据
Think of like a IP packet where there's a
header and then there's a payload. And

136
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:33,157
一般来说，报文头不会被加密。例如
typically the header is not gonna be
encrypted. For example, the header might

137
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:36,905
报文头可能包含数据包的目标地址，那么报文头
contain the destination of the packet, but
then the header had better not be

138
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:40,950
最好不要被加密，免得图中的路由器不知道如何路由
encrypted otherwise routers along the way
wouldn't know where to route the packet.

139
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,225
一般来说，报文头以明文形式发送，但当然
And so, typically the header is sent in
the clear, but the payload, of course, is

140
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:49,500
封装数据总是被加密的，不过你还是希望报文头被认证
always encrypted, but what you'd like to
do is have the header be authenticated.

141
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,907
不用加密，但需认证。那么这就是这些AEAD模式的工作
Not encrypted but authenticated. So this is
exactly what these AEAD modes do. They

142
00:10:55,907 --> 00:11:00,033
它们会认证报文头，然后加密封装数据
will authenticate the header and then
encrypt the payload. But the header and

143
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:04,177
但在认证中，报文头和封装数据是绑定在一起的
the payload are bound together in the
authentication so they can't

144
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:07,803
这样它们不能分开。这不难做到
actually be separated. So this is not
difficult to do. What happens is in these

145
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:14,170
在这三种模式GCM，CCM和EAX中，MAC应用到整个报文数据上
three modes GCM, CCM, and EAX, basically
the MAC is applied to the entire data. But
(报文=报文头+封装数据)

146
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,852
不过加密只被应用到部分需要加密的数据上
the encryption is only applied to the part
of the data that needs to be encrypted.

147
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:22,983
所以我想为大家展示一个带相关数据的认证加密的API
So I wanted to show you what an API
to these authenticated encryption with

148
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:28,716
长什么样。它在OpenSSL里长这样
associated data encryption schemes look
like. So here's what it looks like in OpenSSL.

149
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:33,609
例如，这是一个GCM的API。你可以调用init函数
For example, this is, an API
for GCM. So what you do is you call the

150
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,404
来初始化这个加密模式，然后注意给它一个密钥
init function to initialize the encryption
mode, and you notice you give it a key and

151
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:40,609
和新鲜值。这个新鲜值也不必是随机的
the nonce. The nonce again,
doesn't have to be random, but it has to

152
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:44,402
但它必须是唯一的。初始化后，调用这个加密函数
be unique. And after initialization, you
would call this encrypt function, where

153
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:48,169
给它需要认证、但不需要加密的相关数据
you see that you give it the associated
data that's gonna be authenticated, but

154
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:51,794
然后给它需要认证和加密的数据
not encrypted. You give it the data, and
it's gonna be both authenticated and

155
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,752
函数就会返回整个数据加密后的密文
encrypted. And it gives you back the full
cipher text, which is an encryption of the

156
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:59,582
不过当然，不包括add，因为add需要以明文形式发送
data, but of course does not include the
AEAD, because the AEAD is gonna be sent in

157
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:04,535
那么现在我们理解了这个"先加密后MAC"的机制
the clear. So now that we understand
this mode of encrypt-then-MAC, we can go

158
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:09,951
我们可以回到MAC安全性的定义，我可以为大家解释
back to the definition of MAC security and
I can explain to you something that might

159
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:13,970
定义里一些看起来略难懂的地方。如果大家还记得
have been a little obscure when we looked
at that definition. So if you remember,

160
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,570
安全MAC的定义的要求之一是
one of the requirements that followed from
our definition of secure MACs meant that

161
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:25,689
给定信息M的信息、MAC对，攻击者不能产生
given a message-MAC pair on a message M,
the attacker cannot produce another tag on

162
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:30,386
同样的信息M的另一个标签。换句话说，
即使攻击者已经有了信息M的一个标签
the same message M. In other words, even
though the attacker already has a tag for

163
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:34,771
他也不应该能够产生同样信息M的一个新的标签
the message M, he shouldn't be able to
produce a new tag for the same message M.

164
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:39,382
还不太清楚为什么这点很要紧？谁在乎这点呢？
And it's really not clear, why does that
matter? Who cares, if the adversary already

165
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:44,038
如果攻击者已经有了信息M的一个标签，谁在乎
他是否能产生另一个标签？
has a tag on the message M, who cares if
he can produce another tag? Well, it turns

166
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:48,828
实际上如果MAC没有这一性质，换句话说
out if the MAC didn't have this property. 
In other words, given a message-MAC pair

167
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:53,618
给定一对信息和MAC，你能产生同样信息的另一个MAC
you can produce another MAC on
the same message, then that MAC would

168
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:58,694
那么这个MAC就会造成一个不安全的"先加密后MAC"
的模式。如果我们想让我们的"先加密后MAC"
result in an insecure encrypt-then-MAC mode.
And so if we want our encrypt-then-MAC to

169
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:03,961
具有密文完整性，很重要的一点是，我们的MAC安全性
have cipher text integrity, it's crucial
that our MAC security would imply this strong

170
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:08,910
蕴涵着这个安全观点，当然是因为我们定义得正确
notion of security, which, of course, it
does because we defined it correctly.

171
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,613
那么我们看会出错的，事实上容易产生这种伪造
So let's see what would go wrong, if, in
fact, it was easy to produce this type of

172
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:18,081
我会告诉大家一种在"先加密后MAC"系统上的
forgery. So what I'll do is I'll show you
a chosen cipher text attack on the

173
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:22,784
选择密文攻击。由于这个系统有一种选择密文攻击
resulting encrypt-then-MAC system. And
since the system has a chosen cipher text

174
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:27,193
这就意味着它不提供认证加密
attack on it, it necessarily means that it
doesn't provide authenticated

175
00:13:27,193 --> 00:13:31,458
我们来看看。一开始，攻击者发送两个信息
encryption. So let's see. So the
adversary's gonnna start by sending two

176
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,861
M0和M1。通常他会收到
messages, M0 and M1. And he's gonna
receive, as usual, the encryption of one

177
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:39,522
M0或M1的加密结果。由于我们使用"先加密后MAC"
of them, either the encryption of M0 or
the encryption of M1. And since we're

178
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:44,907
攻击者收到的密文我们记为C0
using encrypt-then-MAC, the adversary
receives the cipher text we'll call it C0

179
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:49,883
C0上有一MAC。我们说过，给定信息的MAC
and a MAC on the cipher text C0.
Well now we said that given the MAC on

180
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:53,827
攻击者可以产生同样信息的另一个MAC
a message the adversary can produce
another MAC on the same message. So what

181
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:57,994
这样他将产生信息C0的另一个MAC
he's gonna do is he's gonna produce
another MAC on the message C0. Now he has

182
00:13:57,994 --> 00:14:03,532
现在他有了一个新的密文(C0,T')，是一个完全有效的密文
a new cipher text (C0,T'), which is a
perfectly valid cipher text. T' is a

183
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:09,558
T'是C0的一个有效MAC。所以，攻击者可以提交
valid MAC of C0. Therefore, the adversary
now can submit a chosen cipher text query

184
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:14,492
C'的一个选择密文的询问，这是一个有效的选择密文的询问
on C' and this is a valid chosen
cipher text query because it's different

185
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:19,288
因为它和C不同，它是一个新的密文。可怜的挑战者
from C. It's a new cipher text. The poor
challenger now is forced to decrypt this

186
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:23,278
被迫去解密这个密文C'，然后发送C'的解密
cipher text C' so he's going to send
back the decryption of C'. It's a

187
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:29,093
它是一个有效的密文，所以C'的解密是信息Mb
valid cipher text therefore the decryption
of C prime is the message Mb but now the

188
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:32,318
但现在攻击者就学得了b的值，因为他可以测试
attacker just learned the value of B
because he can test whether Mb is equal to

189
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:37,371
Mb等于M0还是M1。因此他能输出b
M0 or MB is equal to M1. As a result he
can just output B and he gets advantage

190
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:43,468
以优势1赢得这个机制。如果我们的MAC安全性
one in defeating the scheme. And so
again if our MAC security did not imply

191
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:48,471
不蕴涵着这里的性质，那么在这个"先加密后MAC"系统上
有一个选择密文攻击
this property here. Then, there would be a
chosen cipher text attack on encrypt-then-MAC.

192
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:53,181
因此，它将是不安全的。所以我们正确定义了MAC的安全性
And therefore, it would not be secure. So the
fact that we define MAC security correctly

193
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:57,241
意味着"先加密后MAC"的确提供了认证加密
means that encrypt-then-MAC really does
provide authenticated encryption. And

194
00:14:57,241 --> 00:15:01,728
我们讨论过的所有MAC都满足这一很强的
throughout all the MACs that we discussed
actually do satisfy this strong notion of

195
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:06,146
不可伪造性的观点。有趣的是，故事还没有结束
unforgeability. So, interestingly, this is
not the end of the story. So, as we said

196
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:10,385
我们在引入认证加密的概念之前曾说过，
before the concept of authenticated
encryption was introduced everyone was

197
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:15,295
人们以不同的方式组合MAC和加密，以期获得认证加密
just combining MACs and encryption in
various ways in the hope of achieving

198
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:19,201
在认证加密的观点被严格地形式化后
some authenticated encryption. After
the notion of authenticated encryption

199
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:23,553
人们开始搔脑袋，说
became formalized and rigorous, people
kind of started scratching their heads and said,

200
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:28,130
等等，比起组合MAC和加密机制，也许我们可以
hey, wait a minute. Maybe we can achieve
authenticated encryption more efficiently

201
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,722
更加有效地获得认证加密。事实上
than by combining a MAC and an encryption
scheme. In fact, if you think about how

202
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:37,366
如果考虑MAC和加密的组合是如何工作的，
比如说组合计数器模式和CMAC
this combination of MAC and encryption
works, let's say we combine counter mode

203
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:42,134
那么对每个明文分组，首先必须使用
with CMAC, then for every block of
plaintext, you first of all have to use

204
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:46,419
你的分组密码以计数器模式，然后必须再次使用分组密码
your block cipher for counter mode, and
then you have to use to your block cipher

205
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:51,357
运行CBC-MAC。这意味着如果你把CPA安全的加密
again, for the CBC-MAC. This means that if
you're combining CPA secure encryption with a

206
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:55,943
和一个MAC组合起来，对每个明文分组，
你必须计算你的分组密码两次
MAC, for every block of plaintext, you
have to evaluate your block cipher twice,

207
00:15:55,943 --> 00:16:00,535
一次计算MAC，一次计算加密机制
once for the MAC and once for the
encryption scheme. So the natural question

208
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:05,396
自然问题就来了，我们能否由一个PRP
直接构建一个认证加密机制
was, can we construct an authenticated
encryption scheme directly from a PRP,

209
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:10,345
这样一来我们可以对每个分组，只计算PRP一次
such that we would have to only evaluate
the PRP once per block? And it turns out

210
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:14,117
实际上答案是肯定的，有这个漂亮的构造叫做OCB
the answer is yes, and there's this
beautiful construction called OCB, that

211
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:18,343
它能做你想要的一切，而且比从加密和MAC分别构造的机制
pretty much does everything you want, and
is much faster than constructions that are

212
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:22,467
快很多。那么我写下了OCB的机制
separately built from an encryption and a
MAC. So I wrote down, kind of a schematic

213
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:26,290
我不想解释太多细节。我从高层次来解释一下
of OCB. I don't want to explain it in
detail. I'll just kind of explain it at a

214
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,025
这里有我们的输入明文，在这上面
high level. So here we have our input
plain text, here at the top. And you

215
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:34,540
大家注意，首先，OCB是可并行的，完全可并行的
notice that, first of all, OCB is
parallelizable, completely parallelizable.

216
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,700
所以每个分组可以被单独加密
So every block can be encrypted separately of
every other block. The other thing to

217
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,338
另一件事是，如我所保证的，对每个明文分组
你只需计算一次分组密码
notice is that as I promised, you only
evaluate your block cipher once per plain

218
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:49,318
然后在最后再计算一次分组密码，以构建
text block. And then you evaluate it one
more time at the end to build your

219
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:53,887
认证标签，那么除去分组密码部分，OCB的开销是最小的
authentication tag and then the overhead
of OCB beyond just a block cipher is

220
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:58,749
你只需计算一个非常简单的函数P
minimal. All you have to do is evaluate a
certain very simple function P. The

221
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:02,844
新鲜值交给了P，密钥也给了P
nonce goes into the P you notice, the
key goes into this P and then there is a

222
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:08,238
然后还有一个分组计数器交给了P。所以
你只需计算这个函数P
block counter that goes into this P. So
you just evaluate this function P, twice

223
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:12,748
每个分组算两次，然后与之前的结果异或
for every block and you XOR the result
before and after encryption using the

224
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:17,553
使用分组密码加密之后，就结束了。你获得了
block cipher and that's it. That's all you
have to do and then you get a very fast

225
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:22,241
一个快速有效的，由分组密码构建的认证加密机制
and efficient authenticated encryption
scheme built from a block cipher. So OCB

226
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,065
所以OCB有一个附带的很好的安全性定理
actually has a nice security theorem
associated with it and I am going to point

227
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:29,567
在本章末，我要指出一篇关于OCB的论文
to a paper on OCB when we get to end of
this module where I list some further

228
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:34,457
届时我会列出一些大家可进一步阅读的论文。
大家可能想知道
reading papers that you can take a look
at. So you might be wondering if OCB is so

229
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:40,168
如果OCB比目前看到过的其他机制都好，包括CCM, GCM
much better than everything you've seen so
far, all these three standards CCM, GCM and

230
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:46,037
以及EAX，为什么OCB没怎么被使用？为什么OCB不是标准？
EAX why isn't OCB being used or why isn't
OCB the standard? And the answer is a

231
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:50,729
这是个令人悲伤的答案。OCB没被应用的主要原因
little sad. The primary answer that
OCB is not being used is actually because

232
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:54,567
是因为各种各样的专利。我这里就不提了。
of various patents. And I'll just leave it
at that. So to conclude this section I

233
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:58,216
总结一下本节，我想给大家一些性能参数
wanted to show you some performance
numbers. So here on the right I listed

234
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:02,368
右边我列了这些大家不该用的模式的性能参数
performance numbers for modes that you
shouldn't be using. So this is for

235
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:07,879
这是随机计数器模式，这是随机CBC
randomized counter mode, and this is for
randomized CBC. And you can see also the

236
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:12,460
大家还可以看到CBC-MAC的性能和CBC加密的性能基本一样
performance of CBC MAC is basically the
same as the performance of CBC encryption.

237
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,221
现在这里是认证加密模式
Okay. Now here are the authenticated
encryption modes, so these are the ones

238
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:20,083
所以这些是大家应当使用的模式了，
右边的大家不要用
that you're supposed to using, these
you're not supposed to be using on their

239
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,795
这两个，大家永远不应该使用这两个
own, right. These two, you should never
ever use these two because they only

240
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:27,858
因为它们只提供CPA安全，它们不提供
对抗主动攻击的安全性
provide CPA security, they don't
actually provide security against active

241
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:31,669
大家只应该使用认证加密来进行加密
attacks. You're only supposed to use
authenticated encryption for encryption.

242
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,509
所以我列了这三个标准的性能参数
And so I listed performance numbers
for the three standards. And let me remind

243
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:40,109
让我提醒大家，GCM使用了非常快速的哈希函数。
然后它在加密中使用了计数器模式
you that GCM basically uses a very fast
hash. And then it uses counter mode for

244
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:43,770
你可以看到，计数器模式的GCM的开销
actual encryption. And you can see that
the overhead of GCM over counter mode is

245
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:49,554
相对是很小的。CCM和EAX都使用了一个
基于分组密码的加密
relatively small. CCM and EAX both use a
block cipher based encryption and a

246
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:54,627
和一个基于分组密码的MAC。因此它们的运行时间
大约是计数器模式的两倍
block cipher based MAC. And as a result
they're about twice as slow as counter

247
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:59,196
大家看到，OCB是这些当中最快的
modes. You see that OCB is actually the
fastest of these, primarily because it

248
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:03,820
主要因为它对每个明文分组只使用一次分组密码
only use the block cipher once per message
block. So based on these performance

249
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,328
根据这些性能参数，大家会认为GCM正是
应该一直使用的正确模式
numbers, you would think that GCM is
exactly the right mode to always use. But

250
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:12,659
但实际上，如果你在空间有限的硬件设备上，GCM并不理想
it turns out if you're on the space
constrained hardware, GCM is not ideal.

251
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:16,709
主要是因为它的实现需要比其他两个模式更多的代码
Primarily because its implementation
requires larger code than the other two

252
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:21,323
但是，如我所说，Intel特地加了指令
modes. However, as I said, Intel
specifically added instructions to speed

253
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:26,064
来加速GCM模式。因此在Intel体系结构上实现GCM
up GCM mode. And as a result, implementing
GCM on an Intel architecture takes

254
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:30,315
只需要很少的代码。但在其他硬件平台上，
比如说智能卡或其他受限的硬件环境
very little code. But on other hardware
platforms, say in smart cards or other

255
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:34,745
实现GCM的代码大小会比其他两个模式
constrained environments, the code size
for implementing GCM would be considerably

256
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:39,387
大得多。但如果代码大小不受限制的话
larger than for the other two modes. But
if code size is not a constraint then GCM

257
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,928
那么GCM是正确的选择。总结一下本节，我想再说一次
is the right mode to use. So to summarize
this segment I want to say it one more

258
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:48,267
当你想加密信息时，你必须使用认证加密模式
time that when you want to encrypt
messages you have to use an authenticated

259
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:52,716
推荐的方法是使用这些标准中的一个
encryption mode and the recommended way to
do it is to use one of the standards,

260
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:57,037
这三个标准中的一个，以提供认证加密
namely one of these three modes for
providing authenticated encryption.

261
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:59,846
不要自己实现加密机制。换句话说
Don't implement the encryption scheme yourself.
In other words don't implement

262
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:05,842
不要自己先加密后MAC，就使用三个标准中的一个
encrypt-then-MAC yourself. Just use one of these
three standards. Many crypto libraries

263
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:10,513
现在许多密码学库提供了这三种模式的标准API
now provide standard API's for these three
modes and these are the one's you should

264
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:14,347
你应该使用这些，而不是别的。下一节，我们要看
be using and nothing else. In the next
segment we're going to see what else can

265
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,500
当你试图自己实现认证加密时，还会发生什么错误
go wrong when you try to implement
authenticated encryption by yourself.
